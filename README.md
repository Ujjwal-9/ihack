1) Setup Project Dependencies:

`$ ./setup.sh`

2) If you want to **train** the network:

`$ ./train.sh`

3) If you want to **Test** the model:

`$ python test.py`

4) Convert your model to protopub format - tensorflow (openvino compatible):

`$ ./h52pb.sh`

5) Convert PB to IR:

`$ ./pb2IR.sh`
```
